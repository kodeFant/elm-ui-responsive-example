# Elm UI Responsive Layout Example
A lightweight example on creating a responsive type-safe layout with Elm-UI as described here: 
https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/Element#responsiveness

This is a simple Parcel Project using TypeScript and Elm.

Instead of using dedoders on JavaScript/TypeScript interop, I recommend [elm-typescript-interop](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-typescript-interop) for auto generating TypeScript types on Elm Ports and Flags.

Clone the project and navigate to the project folder then cd into the `elm-ui-solution` folder.

```bash
cd  elm-ui-solution
```

Then build and run in development mode

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```
